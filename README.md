# CS5242 Project



2 set of data :

- one set of proteins
- one set of ligens

Find for each protein 10 ligens that could fit in the protein. If one is matchs : works !

Classification problem for a couple protein/ligen : fit / not fit

For training : each protein binds to only one ligen

Features:

- $(x,y,z)$
- atom type 

Final score : $ \propto$ total of match of proteins
